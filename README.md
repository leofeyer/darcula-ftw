## ANSI colors in iTerm2

Some colors in the iTerm2 profile had to be adjusted so that they look the same
as in the Terminal app:

Palette      | Hex       | RGB
---          | ---       | ---
Green        | `#549a34` | `84 154 52`
Yellow       | `#c3ae4f` | `195 174 79`
Cyan         | `#4e9798` | `78 151 152`

Even with the adjusted colors, the Terminal app seems to display the fonts
brighter than iTerm2:

### iTerm2

<img src="./iTerm2/iTerm2.png" alt>

### Terminal

<img src="./Terminal/Terminal.png" alt>

## Changes

Two things have been changed besides the color scheme:

 * No italic styles (just a matter of personal preference)
 * No green phpDoc comments (they are now gray like all other comments)

## Installation

Check the `README.md` files in the application folders for instructions.
